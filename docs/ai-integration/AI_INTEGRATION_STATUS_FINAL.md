## What's Temporarily Disabled 🚧

### WebLLM Integration

- **Status:** Temporarily disabled due to dependency issues
- **Reason:** WebLLM package has complex dependencies that need proper configuration
- **Impact:** Users must use Ollama for now (which is the recommended option anyway)
- **Future:** Can be re-enabled once dependency issues are resolved

## How to Use AI Features

### For Users:

1. **First Time Setup:**
   - Open Viny
   - AI onboarding modal appears automatically
   - Click "Install AI Assistant"
   - Wait for installation (progress shown)
   - Start asking questions!

2. **Using AI Search:**
   - Press `Cmd+K` to open search
   - Type a question (e.g., "What did I write about React?")
   - AI will answer based on your notes
   - Regular search still works for keywords

3. **Managing AI:**
   - Go to Settings > AI
   - Enable/disable features
   - Change AI model
   - Check provider status

### For Developers:

1. **Architecture:**

   ```
   AIService (unified interface)
   ├── OllamaService (local AI)
   └── WebLLMService (browser AI - disabled)
   ```

2. **Key Files:**
   - `/src/services/ai/AIService.ts` - Main AI service
   - `/src/services/ai/OllamaService.ts` - Ollama integration
   - `/src/services/ai/OllamaInstaller.ts` - Auto-installation
   - `/src/components/ai/AIOnboardingModal.tsx` - Onboarding UI
   - `/src/hooks/useAISearch.ts` - AI-enhanced search

## Testing the Integration

1. **Clear settings to trigger onboarding:**

   ```javascript
   localStorage.removeItem('viny-settings')
   ```

2. **Reload the app**

3. **Follow onboarding flow**

4. **Test AI search:**
   - Create some notes
   - Press Cmd+K
   - Ask "What are my recent notes about?"
   - See AI-powered answer

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "AIService.ts GET error"

**Solution:** WebLLM is temporarily disabled. This error can be ignored.

### Issue: "Ollama not connecting"

**Solution:**

1. Check if Ollama is running: `ollama list`
2. Start Ollama: `ollama serve`
3. Pull a model: `ollama pull llama3.2:latest`

## Summary

The AI integration is **production-ready** with Ollama support. Users get:

- 🚀 Automatic AI installation
- 🔒 100% private, local AI
- 💬 Natural language Q&A
- 🎯 Smart search capabilities
- ⚙️ Full control in settings

WebLLM support can be added later as an enhancement, but the current implementation provides a complete AI experience for Viny users.
