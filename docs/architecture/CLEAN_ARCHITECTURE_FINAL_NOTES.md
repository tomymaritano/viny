# Clean Architecture - Final Notes

## âœ… Clean Architecture Implementation Complete

The clean architecture has been successfully implemented and is running. All tasks have been completed.

## ðŸ“‹ Non-Critical Console Messages

### 1. CSP Violations (wasm-eval, eval)

These are Content Security Policy warnings from certain libraries trying to use eval/wasm. They don't affect functionality but appear in development mode. These are typically from:

- Development tools
- Some third-party libraries
- React DevTools

**Impact**: None - The app works correctly
**Fix**: Can be ignored in development

### 2. Ollama Service Connection Refused

```
GET http://localhost:11434/api/tags net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
```

This is expected if the Ollama AI service is not running locally.

**Impact**: AI features won't be available
**Fix**: Install and run Ollama if AI features are needed

### 3. React DevTools Suggestion

This is a standard React suggestion to install DevTools for better debugging.

**Impact**: None
**Fix**: Optional - Install React DevTools browser extension
