## 🎯 Next Steps

### **Immediate (Today)**

1. Create NotebookServiceV2 tests
2. Create useNotesQuery hook tests
3. Create cleanUIStore tests
4. Run all tests and fix failures

### **Tomorrow**

1. Complete remaining component tests
2. Add integration tests
3. Set up E2E test framework
4. Create CI/CD test pipeline

### **This Week**

1. Achieve 80% test coverage
2. Performance benchmarks
3. Load testing with 1000+ notes
4. Security testing

## 🐛 Issues Discovered During Testing

1. **Mock Dependencies**
   - Need to standardize mock patterns
   - Consider creating test utilities

2. **TypeScript Strictness**
   - Some type assertions needed in tests
   - May need to improve type exports

3. **Test Data**
   - Need centralized test data factory
   - Consistent mock data across tests

## 📈 Metrics

- **Tests Written:** 3 files, ~50 test cases
- **Time Spent:** 1 hour
- **Estimated Completion:** 3-4 days for full suite
- **Current Coverage:** ~15% (rough estimate)

## 🔧 Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test NotesListV2

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch

# UI mode
npm run test:ui
```

## 📝 Notes

- V2 architecture makes testing much easier
- Clean separation of concerns pays off
- Mocking is straightforward with dependency injection
- TanStack Query testing requires QueryClient wrapper
