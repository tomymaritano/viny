# Phase 1: Technical Debt Elimination

> **Duration:** 2-3 weeks  
> **Priority:** 🔴 Critical  
> **Dependencies:** None  
> **Deliverables:** Clean foundation for future development

## 🎯 Objective

Eliminate critical technical debt that blocks future development and creates maintenance overhead. This phase focuses on establishing clean patterns, proper typing, and production-ready code quality before adding new features.

## 📊 Current State Assessment

### Storage Architecture Issues

- **Mixed Patterns:** 47 direct localStorage calls alongside repository pattern
- **Inconsistent APIs:** PouchDB vs localStorage vs Electron storage
- **Error Handling:** Limited error recovery and retry logic
- **Testing:** Insufficient coverage of storage operations

### TypeScript Coverage Issues

- **Coverage:** ~30% TypeScript adoption
- **Missing Types:** Many components still use `any` or no types
- **Configuration:** No main `tsconfig.json` at project root
- **Strict Mode:** TypeScript strict mode not enabled

### Logging & Debug Issues

- **Console Logs:** 118 occurrences across 41 files
- **Production Risk:** Sensitive data potentially logged
- **Debug Code:** Development-only code in production builds
- **Performance:** Unnecessary logging overhead
