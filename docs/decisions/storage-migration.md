# ADR-001: Storage Architecture Migration Strategy

> **Status:** Proposed  
> **Date:** 2025-07-18  
> **Deciders:** Development Team  
> **Technical Story:** Phase 4 - Database Migration Strategy

## Context

The current application uses PouchDB for local storage with limited sync capabilities. As we move toward a production-ready system with cross-device synchronization, we need to evaluate and migrate to a more suitable database architecture that supports:

- Real-time synchronization across devices
- Conflict resolution for collaborative editing
- Scalable performance for large datasets
- Modern TypeScript-first development experience
- Offline-first capabilities with sync

## Decision Drivers

### Technical Requirements

- **Real-time Sync:** Support for instant synchronization across multiple devices
- **Conflict Resolution:** Automatic and manual conflict resolution capabilities
- **Performance:** Handle 1000+ notes with sub-100ms response times
- **Offline Support:** Full functionality without internet connection
- **TypeScript Integration:** Native TypeScript support and type safety

### Business Requirements

- **User Experience:** Seamless cross-device experience
- **Scalability:** Support growing user base and data volume
- **Development Velocity:** Faster feature development with modern tools
- **Maintenance:** Reduced technical debt and easier debugging

### Current Issues with PouchDB

- **Performance:** Significant slowdown with large datasets (>500 notes)
- **Bundle Size:** Large footprint (~46KB) impacting initial load
- **Sync Complexity:** CouchDB sync setup is complex for real-time collaboration
- **TypeScript Support:** Limited type safety and modern development experience
- **Maintenance:** Declining community support and updates

## Considered Options

### Option 1: RxDB + Supabase (Recommended)

**Architecture:** Client-side RxDB with Supabase PostgreSQL backend

**Pros:**

- ✅ **Performance:** 3-5x faster than PouchDB for large datasets
- ✅ **Bundle Size:** ~23KB vs PouchDB's 46KB
- ✅ **Real-time Sync:** Native real-time subscriptions via Supabase
- ✅ **TypeScript:** Full TypeScript support with reactive programming
- ✅ **Conflict Resolution:** Built-in CRDT support for automatic conflict resolution
- ✅ **Developer Experience:** Modern API with excellent documentation
- ✅ **Ecosystem:** Active development and growing community
- ✅ **Offline First:** IndexedDB/OPFS adapters with intelligent sync

**Cons:**

- ❌ **Learning Curve:** Team needs to learn RxDB patterns
- ❌ **Migration Complexity:** Requires data migration from PouchDB
- ❌ **Vendor Dependency:** Relies on Supabase for backend (mitigated by PostgreSQL compatibility)

**Cost Analysis:**

- Development: 1-2 weeks migration + learning
- Supabase: $25/month for small team, scales with usage
- Performance gains: Estimated 40% faster user experience

### Option 2: SQLite + PowerSync/Turso

**Architecture:** SQLite with specialized sync service

**Pros:**

- ✅ **Performance:** Excellent local performance with SQL
- ✅ **SQL Familiarity:** Team knows SQL query language
- ✅ **ACID Guarantees:** Strong consistency guarantees
- ✅ **Mature Technology:** Proven reliability and stability

**Cons:**

- ❌ **Paradigm Mismatch:** Relational model vs current document structure
- ❌ **Migration Complexity:** Significant schema redesign required
- ❌ **Sync Complexity:** Manual conflict resolution implementation
- ❌ **Bundle Size:** WASM SQLite adds significant size

### Option 3: PouchDB + CouchDB Enhancement

**Architecture:** Current PouchDB with optimized CouchDB setup

**Pros:**

- ✅ **No Migration:** Minimal changes to existing codebase
- ✅ **Proven Sync:** CouchDB's replication is battle-tested
- ✅ **Team Familiarity:** Current knowledge remains valuable

**Cons:**

- ❌ **Performance Issues:** Fundamental performance limitations remain
- ❌ **Limited Development:** Declining community and updates
- ❌ **TypeScript Support:** Poor integration with modern tooling
- ❌ **Real-time Limitations:** Limited real-time capabilities

### Option 4: Firebase Firestore

**Architecture:** Google's NoSQL document database

**Pros:**

- ✅ **Easy Setup:** Quick to implement and deploy
- ✅ **Real-time:** Built-in real-time subscriptions
- ✅ **Scaling:** Google-managed scaling and performance

**Cons:**

- ❌ **Vendor Lock-in:** Difficult to migrate away from Firebase
- ❌ **Cost:** Expensive for high-usage scenarios
- ❌ **Limited Offline:** Basic offline capabilities
- ❌ **Query Limitations:** Restricted query capabilities

## Decision

**We choose Option 1: RxDB + Supabase**

### Rationale

1. **Performance First:** RxDB's superior performance directly improves user experience
2. **Future-Proof:** Modern architecture supports planned collaboration features
3. **Developer Experience:** TypeScript-first approach accelerates development
4. **Real-time Ready:** Native real-time capabilities for collaboration
5. **Open Source:** Supabase is open source, reducing vendor lock-in risk
6. **Economic Viability:** Performance gains justify migration investment

### Migration Strategy

#### Phase 1: Parallel Implementation (Week 1)

```typescript
// Dual repository support during migration
class HybridDocumentRepository implements DocumentRepository {
  constructor(
    private legacyRepo: PouchDBRepository,
    private modernRepo: RxDBRepository
  ) {}

  async create(document: Document): Promise<Document> {
    // Write to both during migration
    const [legacy, modern] = await Promise.allSettled([
      this.legacyRepo.create(document),
      this.modernRepo.create(document),
    ])

    return modern.status === 'fulfilled' ? modern.value : legacy.value
  }
}
```

#### Phase 2: Data Migration (Week 2)

```typescript
// Comprehensive migration utility
class PouchDBToRxDBMigrator {
  async migrate(): Promise<MigrationResult> {
    const pouchData = await this.exportPouchDBData()
    const validatedData = await this.validateAndTransform(pouchData)
    const migrationResult = await this.importToRxDB(validatedData)

    await this.verifyMigration(migrationResult)
    return migrationResult
  }
}
```

#### Phase 3: Sync Implementation (Week 3-4)

```typescript
// Real-time sync with conflict resolution
class SupabaseSync {
  async syncChanges(): Promise<SyncResult> {
    const localChanges = await this.getLocalChanges()
    const remoteChanges = await this.getRemoteChanges()

    const conflicts = this.detectConflicts(localChanges, remoteChanges)
    const resolved = await this.resolveConflicts(conflicts)

    await this.applyChanges(resolved)
    return { synced: resolved.length, conflicts: conflicts.length }
  }
}
```

## Alternative Considered

If RxDB + Supabase proves problematic during implementation, we have identified **SQLite + PowerSync** as our fallback option. This would require:

1. **Schema Redesign:** Convert document structure to relational tables
2. **Query Rewrite:** Replace document queries with SQL
3. **Sync Implementation:** Custom conflict resolution logic
4. **Performance Testing:** Validate WASM SQLite performance
