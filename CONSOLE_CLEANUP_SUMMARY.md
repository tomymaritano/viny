# Console Statement Cleanup Summary

## Overview

Successfully replaced console statements with proper logger calls throughout the codebase to improve production logging and debugging capabilities.

## Changes Made

### 1. Automated Replacement

- **Total files updated**: 58 files
- **Console statements replaced**: ~120 statements
- **Files skipped**: 2 (placeholder handlers and example code)

### 2. Logger Categories Used

The following specialized loggers were imported based on context:

- `initLogger` - Initialization and startup logs
- `editorLogger` - Editor-related functionality
- `storageLogger` - Storage and data persistence
- `notebookLogger` - Notebook management
- `sidebarLogger` - Sidebar operations
- `noteLogger` - Note operations
- `settingsLogger` - Settings management
- `apiLogger` - API and authentication
- `searchLogger` - Search functionality
- `logger` - General purpose logging

### 3. Key Replacements

- `console.log()` → `logger.info()`
- `console.error()` → `logger.error()`
- `console.warn()` → `logger.warn()`
- `console.info()` → `logger.info()`
- `console.debug()` → `logger.debug()`

### 4. Files Intentionally Skipped

1. **src/components/ui/ContextMenuRadix.tsx** - Contains example handlers with placeholder console.log statements
2. **src/components/auth/LoginPage.tsx** - Contains a placeholder onClick handler for "Forgot password" functionality

### 5. Test Files Excluded

All test files (`*.test.ts`, `*.test.tsx`, `*.spec.ts`) were excluded from replacement as they may legitimately use console statements for test output.

### 6. Development Utilities Preserved

The following files were preserved as they are development utilities:

- `src/utils/logger.ts` - The logger implementation itself
- `src/utils/devHelpers.ts` - Development helper functions
- `src/utils/ai-test.ts` - AI testing utility

## Benefits

1. **Production Safety**: Console statements are now properly controlled by the logger's environment-aware settings
2. **Structured Logging**: All logs now follow a consistent format with timestamps, levels, and context
3. **Security**: PII filtering and rate limiting are applied to all log outputs
4. **Performance**: Logger can be configured to reduce output in production
5. **Debugging**: Better categorization of logs makes debugging easier

## Next Steps

1. Run `npm run type-check` to ensure no TypeScript errors were introduced ✅
2. Run `npm run lint` to ensure code style compliance
3. Test the application to ensure logging works as expected
4. Consider adding logger configuration to settings for user control

## Scripts Created

1. **scripts/cleanup-console-logs.js** - Analysis script to find all console statements
2. **scripts/replace-console-logs.js** - Automated replacement script with dry-run capability

## Usage

To run the analysis again:

```bash
node scripts/cleanup-console-logs.js
```

To perform replacements (with dry-run):

```bash
node scripts/replace-console-logs.js --dry-run
```

To perform actual replacements:

```bash
node scripts/replace-console-logs.js
```
